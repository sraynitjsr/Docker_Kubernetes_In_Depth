### In Kubernetes, Service Types are used to define how a service is exposed to the network.
### Services in Kubernetes are used to provide network access to a set of pods.
### There are several types of services, each with its own characteristics and use cases.

##### ClusterIP: This is the default service type. It exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP address. It's only accessible within the cluster and is suitable for communication between different parts of an application.

##### NodePort: This type exposes the service on each node's IP address at a static port. It opens a specific port on every node in the cluster, which forwards traffic to the service. It's often used when you need to access services from outside the cluster.

##### LoadBalancer: This type exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. The load balancer will distribute incoming traffic to the nodes running the service. It's suitable for scenarios where you need to expose a service externally and have it load-balanced across multiple nodes.
