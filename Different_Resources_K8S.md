# Different Types of K8S Resources of Different Kind

## 1. Pods (kind: Pod): Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes.They can contain one or more containers and share network and storage resources. Pods are used to run a single instance of a process in Kubernetes.

## 2. ReplicationController (kind: ReplicationController): ReplicationControllers ensure that a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times. If pods fail or are deleted, the ReplicationController creates new replicas to maintain the desired state.

## 3. ReplicaSet (kind: ReplicaSet): A ReplicaSet is an updated version of the ReplicationController. It is used to maintain a set number of pod replicas with more advanced selectors.

## 4. Deployments (kind: Deployment): Deployments provide declarative updates to applications. They manage ReplicaSets and allow us to perform rolling updates, rollbacks, and scaling of applications.

## 5. StatefulSets (kind: StatefulSet): StatefulSets are used for stateful applications that require stable network identifiers and ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.

## 6. DaemonSet (kind: DaemonSet): DaemonSets ensure that a copy of a pod runs on all nodes in the cluster, typically for tasks like logging or monitoring.

## 7. Services (kind: Service): Services define a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. They provide network access to a set of pods and can be used for load balancing and service discovery.

## 8. ConfigMap (kind: ConfigMap) and Secret (kind: Secret): ConfigMaps store configuration data, while Secrets store sensitive information. They can be mounted as volumes or exposed as environment variables in pods.

## 9. Ingress (kind: Ingress): Ingress resources provide external access to services within a cluster. They define the rules for routing HTTP and HTTPS traffic to different services based on hostnames and paths.

## 10. PersistentVolume (kind: PersistentVolume) and PersistentVolumeClaim (kind: PersistentVolumeClaim): These resources are used to manage storage in a Kubernetes cluster. PersistentVolumes represent physical storage resources, while PersistentVolumeClaims are used by pods to request storage.

## 11. Namespace (kind: Namespace): Namespaces provide a way to group and isolate resources in a Kubernetes cluster. They can be used for resource organization and access control.

## 12. ServiceAccount (kind: ServiceAccount): Service accounts are used to give pods access to API resources, and they can be associated with specific permissions.

## 13. CustomResourceDefinition (kind: CustomResourceDefinition): CustomResourceDefinitions enable the extension of the Kubernetes API with custom resources. These are often used to define resources for specific applications or controllers.

## These are some of the core resource types in Kubernetes. Kubernetes also supports many other resource types and extensions that allows us to customize and manage applications and infrastructure efficiently.
