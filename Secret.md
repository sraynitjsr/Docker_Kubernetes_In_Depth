## Secrets are a way to store sensitive information in Kubernetes, such as:

#### Database passwords
#### API tokens
#### SSL certificates
#### SSH keys
#### Configuration settings

## Types of Secrets:
## Kubernetes supports two main types of secrets:

#### Opaque Secrets: These are generic key-value pairs. They can store any binary data, but Kubernetes doesn't interpret the data.
#### Service Account Secrets: These secrets are automatically created for each service account in a namespace and can be used to authenticate with the Kubernetes API server.
