## In Kubernetes (k8s), a ClusterRole is a way to define a set of permissions for accessing and interacting with resources across the entire cluster.
## It is a cluster-level resource, meaning that it applies globally to all namespaces within the cluster.

## A ClusterRole is a collection of rules that specify what actions (verbs) are allowed or denied on which resources.
## These resources include objects like pods, services, deployments, and more. Each rule in a ClusterRole defines a set of permissions for a specific API group, resource, and namespace.
