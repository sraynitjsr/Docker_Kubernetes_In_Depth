## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security mechanism in Kubernetes that allows you to define and manage fine-grained access control for resources within a Kubernetes cluster. RBAC helps you regulate who can perform specific actions on Kubernetes resources, ensuring that only authorized users or processes can interact with the cluster. RBAC is essential for securing your Kubernetes environment and enforcing the principle of least privilege.

## Here are the key components and concepts of RBAC in Kubernetes:-

### Roles: A Role is a Kubernetes resource that defines a set of rules specifying which actions (verbs) are allowed on which resources (nouns) within a given namespace. For example, you can create a Role that allows users to read and list Pods within a specific namespace.

### RoleBindings: A RoleBinding binds a Role to one or more users, groups, or service accounts within a namespace. It establishes the link between a specific Role and the entities that should have the permissions defined by that Role.

### ClusterRoles: While Roles are scoped to a particular namespace, ClusterRoles are not namespace-specific and define permissions across the entire cluster. ClusterRoles are suitable for cluster-level access control.

### ClusterRoleBindings: ClusterRoleBindings, like RoleBindings, associate ClusterRoles with users, groups, or service accounts, but at the cluster level. They grant permissions that apply across all namespaces in the cluster.

### Subjects: Subjects in RBAC can be users, groups, or service accounts. They are the entities to which Roles or ClusterRoles are bound to grant access.
