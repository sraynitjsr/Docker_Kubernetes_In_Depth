## What is Helm?

#### Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, a popular open-source container orchestration platform. It simplifies the process of defining, installing, and managing applications and services in Kubernetes clusters.

#### Helm allows us to define, package, and distribute Kubernetes applications as "charts," which are collections of pre-configured Kubernetes resources (such as deployments, services, and config maps) that can be easily deployed in a consistent and repeatable manner.
