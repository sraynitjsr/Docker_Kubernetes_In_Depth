# StatefulSet vs Deployment vs DaemonSet

StatefulSets, Deployments, and DaemonSets are essential Kubernetes resources used for deploying and managing applications. Each serves a specific purpose and is suitable for different scenarios. Here's a comparison between them:

## StatefulSet

- **Use Case**: Best suited for stateful applications like databases where each instance needs stable storage and unique network identifiers.
- **Stability**: Provides stable, unique network identifiers and stable storage for each instance.
- **Scaling**: Supports ordered, graceful scaling and deployment of pods.
- **Rolling Updates**: Supports ordered, controlled updates and rollbacks.
- **Example**: MySQL, MongoDB.

## Deployment

- **Use Case**: Ideal for stateless applications or microservices that can be scaled horizontally.
- **Scaling**: Supports horizontal scaling by adding or removing replicas.
- **Rolling Updates**: Facilitates rolling updates with zero downtime.
- **Automatic Rollbacks**: Supports automatic rollbacks in case of deployment failures.
- **Example**: Web servers, APIs, stateless microservices.

## DaemonSet

- **Use Case**: Suitable for running a copy of a Pod on all (or some) nodes in a cluster.
- **Deployment Strategy**: Runs exactly one pod per node or a subset of nodes, ensuring that specific pods are scheduled on all matching nodes.
- **Typical Use**: Used for monitoring agents, log collectors, or network services like CNI plugins.
- **Scalability**: Can be used to ensure certain system services are running on all nodes in a cluster.
- **Example**: Monitoring agents, log collectors, networking services.

## When to Select Which Kind

- **StatefulSet**: Choose StatefulSet for stateful applications that require stable storage and unique network identifiers, and need ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
- **Deployment**: Select Deployment for stateless applications or microservices that can be scaled horizontally and require rolling updates with zero downtime.
- **DaemonSet**: Use DaemonSet when we need to ensure that all (or some) nodes run a copy of a Pod, typically for system services or agents that should be present on all nodes.

Select the appropriate kind based on the specific requirements and characteristics of an application or service.
